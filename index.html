                <p> Marine pollution is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land and is washed or blown into the ocean. This pollution causes damage to the environment, the health of organisms, and to economic structures worldwide. </p>

                <p> Deforestation is the act of purposeful clearing forested land. In modern times, forests have been cleared to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction which in turn leaves animals without homes and food sources. </p>

                <p> Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological componant that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide.  </p>
